# Hepatitis C

Hepatitis C is an infection caused by a virus that attacks the liver and leads to inflammation.
There is no vaccine for hepatitis C and the best way to prevent it is to avoid behaviors that can spread the disease. Therefore, there is a great importance of carrying out an early diagnosis and the purpose of this work was to analyze Hepatitis C data and make a prediction of machine learning models. Creating a predictive model can lead to early detection of hepatitis C and other liver diseases, allowing for early treatment.

The objective of this work was to analyze data from a public database provided by the University of California Irvine - UCI. The models performed were Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-NearestNeighbors (k-NN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Tree Boosting, Bagging Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, LightGBM Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier. Binary classification methods were used and compared in the prediction of models to determine whether or not the patient has Hepatitis C.
