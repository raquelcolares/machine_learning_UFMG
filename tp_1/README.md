# Classification of Exoplanets

This project of Classification of Exoplanets consists of carrying out a comparison between six classification methods. The methods used were Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Gradient Tree Boosting. The evaluation of the methods were done using the accuracy and k-fold cross-validation with k equal to 5. The methods were tested in a binary classification problem of exoplanet candidates found by NASA's Kepler space probe. An exoplanet is a planet outside the solar system. The probe first identifies signals from possible exoplanets, called the Kepler Object of Interest (KOI). However, not all KOIs are in fact exoplanets, some are false positives of different origins. The task was to classify KOIs between confirmed and false positive exoplanets.
